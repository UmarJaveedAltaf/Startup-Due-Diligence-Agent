# 🧠 Startup Due Diligence Agent  
**Evidence-First AI Agent for Startup Analysis**

An autonomous, evidence-driven AI agent that performs **startup due diligence** with a **strict verification pipeline**.

> ⚠️ **Design Principle:**  
> **No evidence → No acceptance**

The system refuses to speculate and only accepts claims that are **explicitly supported by public, numeric evidence**.

---

## 🚀 What This Project Does

Given a user query like:

> *“Analyze AI healthcare startups in the US with under 50 employees”*

The agent:

- ✅ Extracts **real startup candidates** (no media, no generic terms)
- 🔍 Performs **focused per-company research**
- 📊 Detects **explicit numeric employee counts**
- 🟢 **Accepts** startups *only if* employee count **< 50 is verified**
- 🔴 **Rejects** everything else with **clear reasons**
- 📜 Produces a **full audit log** explaining every decision
- 🖥️ Presents results through a **Gradio web UI**

This mirrors **investor-grade due diligence**, not blog-style summaries.

---

## 🧩 System Architecture

The system follows a **strict, multi-agent verification pipeline** where every decision is evidence-gated.

## 🧠 Core Design Philosophy

- ❌ No guessing  
- ❌ No extrapolation  
- ❌ No vague “early-stage” assumptions  
- ✅ Explicit **numeric evidence only**  
- ✅ Transparent rejection reasons  
- ✅ Full audit trail  

This makes the system **trustworthy, auditable, and defensible**.

## 🔍 Employee Count Verification (Key Feature)

A startup is **ACCEPTED only if**:

- A **numeric employee count** is found  
- The count is **explicitly stated** in public sources  
- The number is **strictly under 50**

### Examples

| Evidence Found | Result |
|---------------|--------|
| “~33 employees” | ✅ Accepted |
| “28 employees” | ✅ Accepted |
| “50 employees” | ❌ Rejected |
| “Early-stage startup” | ❌ Rejected |
| “Small team” | ❌ Rejected |
| No number | ❌ Rejected |

This logic is **enforced in `agents/evidence.py`** and **cannot be bypassed**.

## 🖥️ Web UI (Gradio)

The UI displays:

- 🟢 **Accepted Startups** (employee count verified)
- 🔴 **Rejected Candidates** (with reasons)
- 📜 **Full Audit Log** (every decision explained)

### ▶ Run the UI

```bash
python ui/app.py
```
